# RobustDataScienceStudent

This Python module implements the RobustDataScienceStudent class, an extension of the TUstudent class, designed for numerical programming tasks. It includes methods for integral computation, linear algebra, and least-squares regression, with clear outputs and visualizations.

## Features

### Integral Computation:
- Compute 𝑦=𝑒<sup>-xsup>cos⁡(𝑥) and its derivative.
- Calculate mean, variance, and standard deviation for a specified range.
- Plot results and find key thresholds.

### Linear Algebra Solver:
- Solve systems of linear equations 𝐴𝑥=𝑏

### Least-Squares Regression:
- Perform regression analysis with outputs for coefficients, 𝑡-statistics, and 𝑝-values.

## Requirements :
- Python 3.6+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
